How deploy Rasa bot to website (with docker-compose, unsure how much traffic can handle):
0. Make initial bot through rasa open source on local machine
1. Set up GCP VM with correct specs, set IP address to be persistent
2. Connect Rasa chatbot to GitHub
3. Download / deploy Rasa X through Docker: (https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/install/docker-compose)
    a. curl -sSL -o install.sh https://storage.googleapis.com/rasa-x-releases/0.39.3/install.sh
    b. sudo bash ./install.sh
    c. cd /etc/rasa
       sudo docker-compose up -d
4. Connect RasaX to GitHub
5. Buy domain name, point to RasaX IP, set up route through CloudFare to get HTTPS
5. Follow https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/connectors/your-own-website to make changes to allow socket.io or REST connections
6. Do what you want with connections (I used Rest API with https://github.com/scalableminds/chatroom)
7. Build action server image (connect to DockerHub, add in docker-compose override file)


Keep most up to date always on GitHub.  Update model through RasaX and or local.  Post updated action to DockerHub
